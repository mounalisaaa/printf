# PRINTF PROJECT

## The function made in this project is a custom implementation of the C standard library function printf.

 Not only does _printf handle the usual conversion specifiers like c, s, %, d, i, u, o, x, and X, it also handles some extra special ones like b (binary, baby!) and S (for all those non-printable characters you've been dying to print). But that's not all! _printf also has some fun surprises up its sleeve, like p (pointer, anyone?) and R (rot13-ify your strings, because why not?).
